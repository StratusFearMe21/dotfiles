# Contributing to wob

Please open an GitHub issue or react to an existing issue before making changes to wob. It's not a pleasant situation
to discard someone's work because it's not needed or someone else is already working on that same thing.

## Commit messages

Use plain style with first line limited to 50 characters. Don't use namespaces or tags (fix: message), just write in one
short sentence what changed.
